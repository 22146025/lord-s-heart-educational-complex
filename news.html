        <p>Our campus came alive with color, rhythm, and heritage during the 2025 Cultural Day celebration. Pupils showcased traditional attire and energetic performances, honoring Ghanaian customs while learning about the rich diversity that shapes our community.</p>
        <p>From spirited drumming to graceful dance routines, each presentation reflected weeks of preparation and teamwork. Teachers and parents beamed with pride as pupils confidently narrated the history behind their chosen costumes and cultural expressions.</p>
        <p>Beyond the performances, the event strengthened our commitment to holistic education â€” nurturing body, soul, and mind. By celebrating culture, we build empathy, identity, and a deeper appreciation for the values that anchor us as a Christ-centered school.</p>
        <p>We extend heartfelt thanks to our staff and PTA for their tireless support. We look forward to even more opportunities for our pupils to explore, learn, and lead with excellence.</p>

        <p>As part of Cultural Day, pupils participated in immersive traditional arts and dance workshops led by invited facilitators and our arts department. Learners practiced basic drum patterns, call-and-response songs, and foundational dance steps that celebrate our heritage.</p>
        <p>The workshops fostered teamwork and confidence, with small groups rotating through activity stations. Pupils reflected on how music, movement, and storytelling preserve cultural memory and strengthen community bonds.</p>
        <p>Many students discovered new talents and interests, and teachers noted the positive impact on discipline, coordination, and creative expression. Activities like these remain central to our mission of nurturing excellence in body, soul, and mind.</p>
